# Install froxlor from Tarball

## 0. Prerequisites

For a manual installation, you need to have a recent webserver (apache2 or nginx) with PHP and MySQL/MariaDB-server running.

You should also have at least one (sub-)domain available to use as froxlor's main system hostname (FQDN). This (sub-)domain _cannot_ be used for customers or hosting websites/e-mails. In case you want to use e.g. **mydomain.tld** yourself for your website and email accounts etc. you can just use a subdomain like **froxlor.mydomain.tld** in the installation process. This way, **mydomain.tld** can be added as a domain for a customer.

## 1. Download and extract the tarball

#### Stable build

```shell
# change directory
cd /var/www/html/

# download latest froxlor version
wget https://files.froxlor.org/releases/froxlor-latest.tar.gz

# the content should go in to the folder /var/www/html/froxlor
# note: the archive contains the folder 'froxlor' already!
tar xvfz froxlor-latest.tar.gz

# remove archive
rm froxlor-latest.tar.gz
```

#### Nightly build

::: warning ATTENTION
Nightly builds are current snapshots of the Git repository including dependencies, please only use this if you know what is happening and use it only for testing purposes as new features may not be tested.
:::

## 2. Set Permissions

In order for the webserver to be able to server the files, the owner must be set correctly. Note: If you're using [FCGID](../../admin-guide/configuration/fcgid)/[PHP-FPM](../../admin-guide/configuration/php-fpm) for the froxlor-Vhost, you have to replace the webserver-user with your local froxlor-user.

```bash
chown -R [webserver-user]:[webserver-user] /var/www/html/froxlor/
```

(the 'webserver-user' on most systems is 'www-data' or 'apache')

## 3. Create privileged database user

Log in to MySQL to create a new privileged user (e.g. `froxroot`) which is required for froxlor to add/delete customer mysql users and databases. You need to specify this user as the **_Privileged database user_** in the web-installer.

````shell
mysql -u root
````

To create the user, execute the following commands:

::: warning ATTENTION
Please change the default password (CHANGEM3) in the first line!
:::

```sql
CREATE USER 'froxroot'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'CHANGEM3';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'froxroot'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

The **_Unprivileged database user_** must not exist as it will be created by the installer for you. The default username is `froxlor` but of course you can use any valid username you like.

## 4. Installation via Web-Installer

::: tip NOTE
On some distributions, the default web-root directory differs from **/var/www/html/**. To access froxlor, you need to adjust the default virtual-host to set **/var/www/html/** as document-root.
:::

Now that you have extracted all the files you are ready to (re)start the webserver. You should now be able to access froxlor via `http://{your-ip-address}/froxlor` Just follow the installation-process and froxlor will be installed in no time.

The _unprivileged_ MySQL user does not need to exist, it will be created using the provided root-privileged user by the installation process.
